# Tax Calculation MVC Website Project Overview

This document provides an overview of the Tax Calculation MVC website project. The project aims to calculate taxes based on user input and provides a user-friendly interface for tax calculation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each serving a specific purpose.

### NextGenDB (SQL Server Database Project)

- Project Name: NextGenDB

This module contains the database schema and scripts required for the application. It's designed as a SQL Server Database Project to facilitate easy migration and connection changes. The database stores user information, tax rates, postal codes, and other relevant data.

### NextGen.Contract

- Project Name: NextGen.Contract

This module defines the contract interfaces that provide the contract between different layers of the application. It includes interfaces for repositories and domain services, allowing loose coupling between layers.

### NextGen.Models

- Project Name: NextGen.Models

This module defines the data models, view models, and exception models used throughout the application. It includes Entity Framework (EF) models that map to database tables and view models that represent data for presentation and interaction.

### NextGen.Domain

- Project Name: NextGen.Domain

The domain layer is responsible for implementing business logic and complex operations. It communicates with the repository layer to perform tasks that involve multiple steps and processes. It encapsulates domain-specific rules and calculations related to tax calculation.

### NextGen.Repository

- Project Name: NextGen.Repository

The repository layer is responsible for database interactions and provides a data access layer. It implements the interfaces defined in the contract module. This layer abstracts away the database operations, enabling the domain layer to focus on business logic.

### NextGen.Web

- Project Name: NextGen.Web

This module represents the main MVC application using ASP.NET Core. It serves as the user interface for the tax calculation process. The project uses Bootstrap for styling and includes controllers, views, and frontend assets. It interacts with the domain layer to calculate taxes based on user input.

### NextGen.NUnit

- Project Name: NextGen.NUnit

The NUnit project contains unit tests to ensure the correctness of the application's functionality. It includes tests for both the domain and repository layers, validating business logic and database interactions. These tests help maintain the quality and reliability of the application.

## Project Workflow

1. Users interact with the NextGen.Web MVC application by providing input such as income, postal codes, and other relevant data.

2. The controller in the NextGen.Web project receives the user input and interacts with the domain layer (NextGen.Domain) to calculate taxes based on the specified rules.

3. The domain layer communicates with the repository layer (NextGen.Repository) to fetch tax rates and other data required for tax calculation.

4. The domain layer performs the necessary calculations based on the selected tax calculation type (progressive, flat value, flat rate) and returns the calculated tax amount.

5. The controller in the NextGen.Web project displays the calculated tax amount to the user using views and templates.

6. The NextGen.NUnit project contains unit tests that validate the correctness of the business logic and database interactions in the domain and repository layers.

## Conclusion

The Tax Calculation MVC website project follows a modular architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainable code. Each module serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall functionality of the application. The project's organization allows for easy development, testing, and future enhancements.
